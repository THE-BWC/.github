## Introduction
Welcome to the Black Widow Company (BWC). We are a multi-game, multi-platform, multi-national gaming community. We play a variety of games across multiple genres and platforms. We are a group of mature, dedicated players who have come together for a common goal: to have fun, kick ass, and win.

## Short History
Black Widow Company was officially founded in February of 2003 by four active-duty military guys stationed at Fort Meade, Maryland. Traditionally, the BWC birthday had been celebrated as 01 April 2003, though the core members had been playing various shooters whilst wearing a [BWC] tag long before this.
